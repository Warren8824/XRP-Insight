# models/__init__.py

This file initializes the models package and imports the necessary model classes.

## Imported Models

- `Base`: The base declarative class for SQLAlchemy models
- `MarketData15Min`: Model for 15-minute market data
- `OHLCVData15Min`: Model for 15-minute OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data
- `TechnicalIndicators15Min`: Model for 15-minute technical indicators

## Usage

You can import these models in other parts of the project like this:

```python
from src.models import Base, MarketData15Min, OHLCVData15Min, TechnicalIndicators15Min
```

## Notes

1. The file uses models_logger for logging.
2. There are commented-out imports for potential future models (OnChainData, SocialSentiment, NewsData).
