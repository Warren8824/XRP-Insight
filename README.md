![Project Status: Early Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/Project%20Status-Early%20Development-yellow)

## Overview

XRP Insight is an innovative open-source project aimed at revolutionizing cryptocurrency market analysis and content generation, with a specific focus on XRP. By leveraging state-of-the-art language models, real-time market data, and sophisticated data analysis techniques, XRP Insight aims to generate in-depth, timely content about the XRP market across multiple platforms.

**Note: This project is in its initial development phase. Many features described are planned but not yet fully implemented. We welcome contributions and feedback!**

## Project Goals

1. Automate the collection and analysis of comprehensive XRP market data
2. Generate high-quality, data-driven content about XRP market trends
3. Provide timely insights across multiple platforms (blogs, social media)
4. Maintain consistency and coherence in messaging through an evolving AI persona
5. Offer a scalable solution for crypto content creation and market analysis

## Current Features (Phase 1)

- Data collection from CoinAPI (15-minute intervals) and CoinGecko (30-minute intervals)
- Storage of OHLCV and market data in TimescaleDB
- Basic technical indicator calculations
- Foundational structure for AI-driven content generation (planned)
- Logging system for various components
- Database initialization and historical data backfilling scripts
