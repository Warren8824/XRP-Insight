## Usage

(To be updated as features are implemented)

## Roadmap

- [x] Phase 1 Development - In Progress - see [ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md) for our current plans.
- [ ] Implement advanced technical indicators
- [ ] Develop AI-driven content generation system
- [ ] Create API for data access
- [ ] Implement scheduling system for regular data collection and content generation
- [ ] Develop web interface for content management

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from developers of all skill levels! This is my first big project, and I'm excited to collaborate with others who are passionate about cryptocurrency analysis and AI. Check out the [ROADMAP](ROADMAP.md), to see the long list of tasks we intend on tackling in the coming phases.

To contribute:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

6. Configure GitHub Secrets for CI Workflow

Our project uses GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration (CI) to run tests and ensure that all changes pass before merging. In order to successfully run the CI workflow, certain environment variables (such as database credentials and API keys) must be set up as GitHub Secrets.

If you want to run the CI tests in your own fork or clone of this repository, you will need to set up the required secrets.
